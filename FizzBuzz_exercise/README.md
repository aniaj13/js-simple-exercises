Task: Write a program in JavaScript that prints out numbers from 1 to n, where n is provided as an input to the program.
For each number, if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5,
print "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Requirements:

The program should take an integer n as input and print out the numbers from 1 to n.
If a number is divisible by 3, the program should print "Fizz" instead of the number.
If a number is divisible by 5, the program should print "Buzz" instead of the number.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program should print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
The program should be implemented using JavaScript.
